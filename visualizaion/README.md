# Overview
This project analyzes order value KPIs using an interactive Tableau dashboard to understand month-over-month (MoM) performance changes and identify whether growth is driven by customer volume or spending intensity per customer.

# Business Question
How do order value metrics (AOV, ARPPU) evolve month-over-month, and which product categories and customer segments drive higher-value orders?

Dashboard
* Tableau Public: (링크 삽입)
* Key filters:
    * Date range (MoM comparison)
    * Product category (All, Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology)
    * Sub-category and geography

Key Insights
1. Overall MoM performance weakened in December despite a positive yearly trend, indicating short-term contraction across both volume and value metrics.
2. Office Supplies was the only category showing balanced MoM growth, with increases in customers, AOV, and ARPPU.
3. Furniture growth was volume-driven, while Technology exhibited high ARPPU but strong short-term volatility.
4. High-ARPPU regions did not always align with high order volume, highlighting regional differences in revenue drivers.

Business Implications
* Short-term performance monitoring should prioritize MoM KPIs over YoY trends.
* Investment strategies should distinguish between volume-driven and value-driven categories.
* Targeted, category-specific approaches may outperform broad, uniform growth strategies, especially in high-ARPPU but low-volume segments.
