# Overview
This project analyzes order value KPIs using an interactive Tableau dashboard to understand month-over-month (MoM) performance changes and identify whether growth is driven by customer volume or spending intensity per customer.

# Business Question
How do order value metrics (AOV, ARPPU) evolve month-over-month, and which product categories and customer segments drive higher-value orders?

# Dashboard
* **Tableau Public:** [View Dashboard on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jungwon.hur/viz/Part10-1_KPI/KPIDashboard)
* **Key filters:**
    * Date range (MoM comparison)
    * Product category (All, Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology)
    * Sub-category and geography

# Key Insights
* Overall MoM performance weakened in December despite a positive yearly trend, indicating short-term contraction across both volume and value metrics.
* Office Supplies was the only category showing balanced MoM growth, with increases in customers, AOV, and ARPPU.
* Furniture growth was volume-driven, while Technology exhibited high ARPPU but strong short-term volatility.
* High-ARPPU regions did not always align with high order volume, highlighting regional differences in revenue drivers.

# Business Implications
* Short-term performance monitoring should prioritize MoM KPIs over YoY trends.
* Investment strategies should distinguish between volume-driven and value-driven categories.
* Targeted, category-specific approaches may outperform broad, uniform growth strategies, especially in high-ARPPU but low-volume segments.
