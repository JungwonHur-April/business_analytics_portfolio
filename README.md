## Overview
#### Content
This repository documents my foundational preparation toward becoming a business analytics professional, combining programming foundations, data visualization, and applied projects. It includes hands-on work with analytical tools such as Python and SQL, Tableau-based visual exploration and dashboard analysis, and applied modeling projects addressing business analytics use cases.
#### Approach
Rather than simply writing code, building dashboards, or training predictive models, each exercise emphasizes interpreting results and translating them into actionable business insights. Across projects, analytical outputs are treated as inputs to decision-making, with consistent attention to how patterns emerge in the data, which factors explain observed outcomes, and how those findings can inform practical analytical or strategic choices.
#### Purpose
Together, these practices are designed to mirror real-world business analytics workflows and to build familiarity with the end-to-end analytical pipeline, moving from problem framing and data preparation through modeling and visualization to strategic interpretation. Through this process, the repository reflects a deliberate effort to develop analytical rigor, structured thinking, and the ability to connect quantitative results to business-relevant conclusions.
